# CunilleraReplication

The jsPsych code for an replication of the experiment conducted by Cunillera et al.

In this current version everything seems to work correctly. I have tagged the test trials with data for condition, language version, correct, and whether if a trial is an anchor word or not.

The audio file for streamb.mp3 (the stream of words in language B) needs to be updated, because one of the wors repeats after itself at about 1:27 into the stream. Gabi is working on it and once she gets that to me I can update the file on here.

Let me know if you have any question. Thank you so much!

Esther
